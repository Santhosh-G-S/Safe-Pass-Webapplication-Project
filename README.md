# Safe Pass

**Safe Pass** is a community-driven safety platform that enables users to submit detailed, location-based reports about incidents like theft, harassment, hazards, and other concerns. All reports are visualized on an interactive map, and users can receive AI-powered safety guidance through an intelligent chatbot assistant.
